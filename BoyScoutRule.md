**Principle of Least Astonishment (PLA)**
	- Also known as Principle of Least Surprise (POLS)
	- Well known in user interface design and ergonomics
	- The principle states that the user should not be surprised
by unexpected responses of the user interface.
	-  The user should not be puzzled by appearing or disappearing
controls, confusing error messages, unusual reactions on established keystroke sequences  or other unexpected behavior
- **The Boy Scout Rule**
	-  Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
	- One of their principles states that they should clean up a mess or pollution in the environment immediately, once they’ve found such bad things
	- Developers should apply this principle to our daily work. Whenever we find something in a piece of code that needs to be improved, or which is a bad code smell, we should fix it immediately. And it does not matter who the original author of this piece of code was.
	- Advantages
		- continuously prevent the dilapidation of our code
		- Renaming a poorly named class, variable, function, or method 
	-  Behaviors
		- Decomposing the innards of a large function into smaller pieces 
		- Deleting a comment by making the commented piece of code self-explanatory
		- Cleaning up a complex and puzzling if-else-compound.
		- Removing a small bit of duplicated code
		- Collective Code Ownership.
			- Every team member, at any time, is allowed to make a change or extension on any piece of code.
			- There should be no attitude like
			- “This is not my  code, and that’s Fred’s module. I don’t touch them!”
			- It should be considered to be a high value that other people can take over the code we wrote. Nobody in a real team should be afraid, or have to obtain permission, to clean up the code, or to add new features
